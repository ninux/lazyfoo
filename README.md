This is a personal repository for the *Lazy Foo Productions* tutorial on SDL2
called
[Beginning Game Programming v2.0](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php)

## Goal
I just want to play around with C! As far as I see, SDL is a great way to get
into practical C coding beyond the command-line lessons from K&R (that are
great as well).

If the tutorial is going well for me, I'll think about a second try to code
something for my caanoo I've bought once for coding my own linux-game.
According to my schedule, this is rather utopistic...

## License
Since this repository is about the *Lazy Foo Productions* tutorial, it is
going to have a lot of code from it in here. I will not declare any licensing
on my own but I refer to the
[Lazy Foo Productions FAQ](http://lazyfoo.net/faq.php) that gives very
detailed instructions about these issues.

To avoid any mess with legal issues and license uncertainty I've decided to
split the source directory into two parts. One part will only contain the
code I used (more or less) as-is from the *Lazy Foo Productions* tutorial.
This will be placed at `lazyfoo/src/ext`. The code I made by my own, based
upon the tutorial progress, will be placed at `lazyfoo/src/own`.
